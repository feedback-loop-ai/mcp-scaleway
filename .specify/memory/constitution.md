# MCP Scaleway Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-Native Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

The MCP server MUST be designed for AI-first interaction with clear, machine-parseable interfaces.

- All MCP tools MUST have unambiguous, schema-validated inputs and outputs
- Tool descriptions MUST be explicit, action-oriented, and include usage examples
- Error responses MUST be structured and actionable (no generic error messages)
- The server MUST operate as a stateless proxy to Scaleway APIs—no hidden state or side effects
- Documentation MUST be structured for AI consumption (typed interfaces, JSON schemas, explicit contracts)

**Rationale**: This is an MCP server—its primary consumers are AI agents. Every design decision prioritizes machine comprehension and autonomous operation.

### II. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)

All features MUST follow a three-role workflow with clear separation of concerns:

- **WHAT** (Product): Define user value, acceptance criteria, and priority. Captured in `spec.md`.
- **HOW** (Engineering): Design architecture, data models, and implementation approach. Captured in `plan.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`.
- **VALIDATION** (QA): Verify correctness via automated tests, manual validation, or both. Captured in test suites and `tasks.md` checkpoints.

One person MAY wear multiple hats, but the roles MUST remain distinct in artifacts. Every feature MUST have a spec before implementation begins.

**Rationale**: Clear role separation ensures traceability, reduces rework, and enables parallel work by different agents or humans.

### III. Contract-First API Design

All MCP tools MUST be designed contract-first before implementation:

- Tool schemas MUST be defined in `contracts/` before any code is written
- Input/output types MUST use Zod schemas with strict validation
- Breaking changes to tool signatures MUST be versioned and documented
- Operations MUST map cleanly to documented Scaleway API endpoints—no invented API operations
- Tools MAY expose operations through search/describe/read/call gateway tools when each
  underlying operation has a stable identifier mapping one-to-one to its parity-matrix entry.
  Gateway meta-tools MUST be specified in `contracts/` before implementation. Filtering MUST
  apply equally to discovery and execution; original input validation MUST remain enforced.
- Error codes and messages MUST be consistent across all tools
- A **Scaleway API Reference Spec** MUST be maintained in `specs/scaleway-api/` documenting the full shape of every Scaleway API surface exposed by this server:
  - Every product area (Instances, Block Storage, VPC, Kubernetes, Serverless, Databases, IAM, DNS, Load Balancers, Object Storage, Registry, etc.) MUST have its request/response shapes, error codes, pagination patterns, and authentication flows documented
  - The reference spec MUST be detailed enough to generate contract tests automatically
  - Every underlying operation MUST trace back to a specific Scaleway API endpoint documented in the reference spec; gateway meta-tools trace to their explicit discovery/execution contracts
  - Any new Scaleway API surface added to the server MUST first be documented in the reference spec before implementation

**Rationale**: MCP clients depend on stable, predictable tool contracts. A comprehensive Scaleway API reference spec ensures every tool is backed by a verified, testable contract—eliminating guesswork and enabling 100% validation coverage.

### IV. Operational Excellence

The server MUST be designed for production reliability and observability:

- **Structured Logging**: All operations MUST log structured JSON with request/response tracing
- **Error Handling**: Every Scaleway API error MUST be mapped to a clear, actionable MCP error
- **Health Checks**: Server MUST expose health status for monitoring integration
- **Graceful Degradation**: Connection failures to Scaleway MUST produce helpful error messages, not crashes
- **Security**: No sensitive data (credentials, tokens) in logs; API key configuration MUST be secure

**Rationale**: MCP servers run as infrastructure—operational reliability is non-negotiable for production use.

### V. Simplicity & YAGNI

Start with the simplest solution that could work:

- No premature optimization or over-engineering
- Every architectural decision MUST cite a concrete requirement
- Complexity MUST be justified in writing before implementation
- Delete unused code; dead code is negative value
- Prefer direct Scaleway API mapping over invented abstractions
- No feature creep: if it's not in the spec, don't build it

**Rationale**: Simplicity accelerates development and reduces maintenance burden. The server is a thin proxy layer—keep it thin.

### VI. Fast Feedback Loops (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Development tooling MUST minimize time between code change and validation:

- **Instant Startup**: Runtime and tooling MUST start in milliseconds, not seconds
- **Hot Reload**: Development server MUST support instant code reloading
- **Fast Tests**: Test suite MUST complete in under 5 seconds for unit tests
- **Unified Tooling**: Prefer all-in-one tools (bundler, test runner, package manager) over fragmented toolchains
- **Zero Config**: Tools MUST work out-of-the-box with sensible defaults

**Rationale**: AI-driven development generates rapid iterations. Every second of feedback delay compounds into minutes of wasted time. Modern tooling (Bun ecosystem) provides 10-100x speedups over legacy Node.js toolchains.

### VII. Type Safety & Validation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

All code MUST be type-safe with runtime validation at boundaries:

- TypeScript strict mode MUST be enabled (no `any` types except in type guards)
- All MCP tool inputs MUST be validated with Zod schemas before processing
- Scaleway API responses MUST be validated against expected types
- Configuration MUST be validated at startup—fail fast on misconfiguration
- Tests MUST cover validation edge cases (malformed inputs, unexpected API responses)

**Rationale**: Type safety prevents entire categories of runtime errors. Validation at boundaries catches issues before they propagate.

### VIII. 100% Test Coverage & API Parity (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

Every MCP tool and every Scaleway API surface MUST be tested with full coverage and full parity:

- **100% Code Coverage**: Line and branch coverage MUST be 100% across all source files. No exceptions, no exclusions, no `istanbul ignore` pragmas
- **Full API Contract Parity**: For every Scaleway API endpoint exposed by this server, there MUST be a corresponding contract test that validates:
  - Request shape (required fields, optional fields, types, constraints)
  - Response shape (success payloads, error payloads, status codes)
  - Pagination behavior (cursor-based, offset-based, page tokens)
  - Authentication and authorization flows (API keys, project scoping, IAM)
  - Rate limiting and error code handling
- **Contract Test Traceability**: Every contract test MUST reference the specific Scaleway API endpoint and the Scaleway API Reference Spec entry it validates
- **Parity Matrix**: A machine-readable parity matrix (`tests/parity-matrix.json`) MUST be maintained mapping every Scaleway API operation to its contract test. CI MUST fail if any operation lacks a corresponding test
- **Gateway Traceability**: Each gateway meta-tool MUST carry a `contract_test` entry in
  the parity matrix `meta` section. CI MUST assert the registered gateway surface matches
  those entries exactly and that every underlying operation remains represented in the
  generated runtime metadata. Meta-tools MUST NOT use fabricated endpoint placeholders.
- **No Tool Without Tests**: It MUST be impossible to merge an MCP tool that lacks 100% contract test coverage. CI MUST enforce this gate
- **Regression Safety**: Any Scaleway API behavior change (detected via contract test failure) MUST be triaged, documented, and either adapted or reported upstream

**Rationale**: This server is the AI agent's sole interface to Scaleway infrastructure. A single untested code path or missing API contract can cause silent failures in production—agents operating on cloud infrastructure cannot tolerate ambiguity. 100% coverage and full parity are the minimum bar for a cloud provider proxy.

## Development Workflow

### Feature Lifecycle

1. **Spec**: Product defines WHAT in `specs/[###-feature]/spec.md`
2. **Plan**: Engineering defines HOW in `specs/[###-feature]/plan.md`
3. **Tasks**: Break down into atomic tasks in `specs/[###-feature]/tasks.md`
4. **Implement**: AI/Engineer executes tasks, validates via tests
5. **Review**: Automated checks + optional human review
6. **Deploy**: Merge to main → tagged release

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Requirement | Enforcement |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| Spec Approval | Product sign-off on WHAT | Branch protection |
| Tests Pass | All unit/integration/contract tests green | CI mandatory |
| Coverage | 100% line and branch coverage | CI mandatory (vitest --coverage) |
| API Parity | All Scaleway API operations have contract tests | CI mandatory (parity-matrix check) |
| Type Check | Zero TypeScript errors | CI mandatory |
| Lint/Format | Zero Biome violations | Pre-commit + CI |
| Constitution Compliance | Spec/Plan reference principles | Manual/AI review |

### Branching Strategy

- `main`: Production-ready, always releasable
- `feature/###-name`: Feature branches from main
- No long-lived branches; merge within 48 hours or rebase
- Squash merges for clean history
